# W-Maze Application

This application controls a w-shaped maze for testing cognitive ability in rodents using the W-Track Spatial Alternation Task.

The W-Track Spatial Alternation Task (Frank, Brown, Wilson 2000) has been used to examine the relationship between the spatially related activity of cells in the hippocampus and an animalâ€™s ability to learn to successfully navigate to a goal. In this task, animals must learn to navigate a w-shaped maze in an alternating pattern to receive reward. 

The GUI provides the ability for the user to test an animal on the W-Track Spatial Alternation Task and receive real-time performance data. The program works in conjunction with an Arduino Microcontroller https://github.com/adelekap/W-MazeArduino rewarding the rat for completing the correct pattern of location visits. The application displays the number of correct visits and the number of errors as well as the types of errors the animal is making. This data along with timestamps for events are saved in the directory of the user's choosing. 

The application also provides the ability to fill and clean the feeders for basic maintenance of the w-track.
